    <h1>Health Coaching Management System - Loading Instructions</h1>
    <h4>
      Since I am working with various databases and a REACT website, in order to
      load it, certain steps need to be followed. These steps are as follows:
    </h4>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
      Open the product folder in an IDE (preferably Visual Studio Code). Note:
      the IDE should have a terminal. The IDE screen should look something like
      this:
    </p>
    <img src="/src/assets/img1.jpg" height="400px" />
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Now the database will be hosted on a local HTTP server.</p>
    <p>Firstly open a new terminal</p>
    <img src="/src/assets/img2.jpg" height="250px" />
    <p>
      Then in the terminal, enter the folder where the data is stored. Do so by
      typing <b>"cd src/data"</b> in the terminal and running the command
    </p>
    <img src="/src/assets/img3.jpg" height="150px" />
    <p>
      The database will be hosted using the json-server package. Ensure that you
      have the json-server package installed by typing
      <b>"npm install json-server"</b>. <br />After the installation has
      completed, host the database by typing the command
      <b>"npx json-server datastore.json --port 3001"</b>
    </p>
    <img src="/src/assets/img4.jpg" height="400px" />
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>
      Next, the security and upload server has to be hosted on a local HTTP
      server as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open a new terminal. <br />
      *ENSURE THAT THE EXISTING TERMINAL WITH THE DATABASE HOSTING KEEPS
      RUNNING*
    </p>
    <img src="/src/assets/img5.jpg" height="200px" />
    <p>
      On this new terminal, enter the AdminSide folder by typing the command
      <b>"cd src/AdminSide"</b>
    </p>
    <img src="/src/assets/img6.jpg" height="40px" />
    <p>
      Now, run the security/upload server by typing <b>"node server.js"</b> into
      the terminal
    </p>
    <img src="/src/assets/img7.jpg" height="120px" />
    <p>
      Note: the MAC check has been disabled for the purpose of demonstration,
      yet its evidence can be found in the source code
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Finally, run the website</p>
    <p>Open a new terminal and type <b>"npm run start"</b>. Wait for a few moments till npm builds the website environment. After a while the website should accessible at https://localhost:3000.</p>
    <img src="/src/assets/img8.jpg" height="200px" />
    <hr/>
    <p>In case there is an error in running the website on the system, ensure that node package manager (npm) is updated to the latest version.</p>
